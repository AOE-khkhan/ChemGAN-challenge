INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (TESTED ON MAC OS X 10.7)

After downloading, un-tar the file in your directory of choice. A typical location to store source code is the
/usr/local/src directory:

> cd /usr/local/src
> mv ~/Downloads/biscu-it-1.0.1.tar.gz .
> tar -xvf biscu-it-1.0.1.tar.gz

Install the Python code:

> cd biscu-it-1.0.1
> python setup.py install

This will install all code in your default Python installation directory for third-party code. You can
find this directory back by inspecting the the messages that were generated during the install procedure.
Make sure to add this path to your PYTHONPATH environment variable of your shell, and at a line to
your login-file such as .bash_profile.
